Creative by nature, I enjoy solving problems and developing new digital solutions. 
An agile developer and facilitator, I have a know-how in C programming and python micro services.
I have 20 years of experience in embedded systems product development (hardware - firmware - software). 
My technical background is mainly linked to microcontrollers - fpgas - electronics.

I enjoy using english for my work language, being in a multicultural environment and working with people having different technical - soft or hard - skills.

To understand more how I work, here are my go-to rules:

ðŸŽ¯ KISS : Keep It Simple and Stupid.

ðŸŽ¯ DRY : Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself.

ðŸŽ¯ Consistency beats intensity : Long term strategy.

ðŸŽ¯ Explain it : If it canâ€™t be explained, itâ€™s not understood or too complicated.

ðŸŽ¯ Simplify : If itâ€™s too complicated, break it into smaller pieces.

ðŸŽ¯ Be like water : Go with the flow.

ðŸŽ¯ Be open and transparent : Feedback is key for improvement.

ðŸŽ¯ When it makes sense, break the rules : But do it meaningfully and stay accountable.

Only one rule which canâ€™t be broken:

ðŸŽ¯ Knowledge is multiplied when shared : donâ€™t keep things for yourself.
